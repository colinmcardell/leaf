#### An iPad Synthesizer built using Pure Data & libPd
It sounds like, uh sounds? (buzzzzz, bleep blop blurp)

TODO: Add screenshot here

## Description

leaf is a dual oscillator synthesizer for iPad with a simple filter,
arpeggiator, and delay (w/LPF). Implemented with Pure Data and libPd, leaf has
grown from experimentation with the intention of learning some Pure Data as well
as trying out fast prototyping of audio ideas without having to dig to deep into
the CoreAudio or DSP end of things.

leaf is hopefully useful to others as an example as to some the complexities of
Pure Data, implementation of Objective-C parameter interfacing with libPd, as
well as generally entertaining to play with. By no means should leaf be
considered the "right" way of doing things, as it is slightly over-complicated,
and this overall implementation is screaming for refactors, optimizations and
areas that should be completely ripped out... That being said, leaf is pretty
cool, pretty functional, and ultimately some fun can be had with this project.

## Dependencies
